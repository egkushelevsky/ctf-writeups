# LACTF 2026: rev/three_sat_problem

## Summary
This challenge is an x86 ELF binary which checks if it was given an input string satisfying a 3CNF formula.

**Artifacts**

The only file for this challenge is an ELF x64 binary executable, `three_sat_problem`. It must be run on a Linux machine.

## Context from the Disassembly
At the top of the main method, the executable prompts the user for input.

```001010c1 48 89 df        MOV        RDI=>3sat_buf,input_ptr
001010c4 e8 97 ff        CALL       <EXTERNAL>::fgets
001010c9 48 89 df        MOV        RDI=>3sat_buf,input_ptr
001010cc 48 8d 35        LEA        RSI,[DAT_0011302b]
001010d3 e8 78 ff        CALL       <EXTERNAL>::strcspn
001010d8 48 89 df        MOV        RDI=>3sat_buf,input_ptr
001010db c6 04 03 00     MOV        byte ptr [input_ptr + input_strlen*0x1]=>3sat_
```
It checks that the input it received has the expected length of 1279, not including the null terminator.
```
001010df e8 5c ff        CALL       <EXTERNAL>::strlen
001010e4 48 3d ff        CMP        input_strlen,0x4ff                               Expects strlen of 1279

001010ea 74 09           JZ         LAB_001010f5
```
Then it loops over the input string to check that all the characters are less than 49 (ASCII 0). This tells us that the input must be a binary string. Knowing that this challenge is about satisfiability, we'll likely use that string of bits as boolean assignments.
```
001010ff 8a 03           MOV        input_strlen+0x7,byte ptr [input_ptr]=>3sat_buf
00101101 83 e8 30        SUB        input_strlen+0x4,0x30                            Subtract 48 ('0' - 0)
00101104 3c 01           CMP        input_strlen+0x7,0x1                             Compare to 1
00101106 77 e4           JA         please_be_serious                                Failure: print a        
                                                                                     message and exit
0010110b 48 39 da        CMP        RDX,input_ptr
0010110e 75 ef           JNZ        LAB_001010ff
```
It calls the 3SAT function, and if that returns 1 and a specific character in the string has an odd value, it gets the flag.
```
00101112 e8 72 01        CALL       3sat_func
00101117 84 c0           TEST       3sat_ret,3sat_ret
00101119 74 09           JZ         LAB_00101124
0010111b f6 05 30        TEST       byte ptr [DAT_00115352],0x1                      754 chars into 3sat_buf
00101122 75 11           JNZ        LAB_00101135                                     Flag function
```
Finally, if the input is accepted, it is used to decode the flag from memory.
```

## Context
The core of this challenge is in a function which declares several thousand stack variables and computes if their assignment based on the input string satisfies a boolean expression.

This is an example of a 3SAT problem. 3SAT problems can involve any number of boolean literals, which are assembled into disjunctions of no more than three literals (hence the 3 in 3SAT). Those disjunctive clauses are put together into a CNF expression. This larger expression is said to be “satisfiable“ if there is an assignment to the literals which allows the expression to evaluate to true.

3SAT and related satisfiability problems are NP-complete. There are, however, fast exponential solvers.

## Solution
This challenge was more of a riddle than a vulnerability, an unfortunate fact which crossed my mind much too far into this writeup. It was also deeply unsatisfying for a satisfiability challenge.

I tried multiple approaches to extracting the correct assignment from the 3SAT function, first trying to lift the expression directly from both the disassembly and decompilation but facing issues with getting Angr's solver to find a satisfiable assignment. What ultimately succeeded was writing a Python [script](./working_symbolic_execution.py) to symbolically execute the function from the disassembly using Capstone. It parses instructions accessing the input buffer and constructing the clause, then uses Z3's solver to assemble the 3CNF expression. With this script, I was finally able to get the binary string and pass it into the challenge.

## Remediation
Though this challenge was not about a vulnerability, there are a few ways it could be made more difficult to reverse. My main suggestion is obfuscating the strings: for a simply structured program, they are quite instructive of the program flow without much reversing effort.
